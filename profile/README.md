# CRESCENTS  
### Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center

In 2023, the National Science Foundation awarded $15 million dollars to establish the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center, CRESCENT. CRESCENT is the nation’s first subduction zone earthquake hazards center — a nexus for earthquake science and hazards research. CRESCENT has three overarching goals:

* To develop a better foundational understanding of Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquakes and their associated hazards and to transfer this knowledge to other subduction zones
* To promote diversity and to train the next-generation of geoscientists to address the challenges presented by our dynamic planet
* To provide a systematic approach to collaboration between researchers in academia and those in agencies that have mandates to produce hazard information that stakeholders, practitioners, and the public at large can trust and use   

Please join us as we establish a new paradigm of collaborative Earth science research for societal good.
